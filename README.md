> [!CAUTION]
> This piece of software is meant to be my personal project.
> You REALLY don't want to use it in production environment for several reasons (non-exhaustive):
> * It is made solely for educational purposes
> * I really suck at Rust
> * It uses peppered SHA-1 as password hashing algorithm (which is kinda bad)
> * Just look at the code, it's probably awful...
